(It's equivalent to say $G(s)$ is semiproper if $G(i\\omega) \\to d \\neq 0$ as $\\omega \\to \\infty$.) A notable example of a semiproper transfer function is the sensitivity function $S$.\n\n$G(s)$ is **improper** if $G(i\\omega) \\to  \\infty$ as $\\omega \\to \\infty$ or when the degree of the numerator exceeds that of the denominator.\n\nSo what exactly makes the frequency response so compelling? Well, plugging a sinusoidal input into a linear time-invariant (LTI) system yields a sinusoidal response of the same frequency (in the steady-state). However, the response *may* differ in amplitude and phase.\n\nConsider an LTI system with input $u(t) = U_0 \\sin(\\omega t + \\alpha)$ and output is $y(t) = Y_0 \\sin(\\omega t + \\beta)$. We define **amplification** (or **gain**) as:\n\n$$A := \\frac{Y_0}{U_0} = |G(i\\omega)|$$\n\nEssentially, it's a ratio of the output wave's amplitude to the input wave's amplitude.\n\nThe **phase shift** $\\varphi := \\beta - \\alpha = \\measuredangle G(i\\omega)$ is the difference between the phases of the input and output signals.\n\nWe can also use phasor notation to represent sinusoidal functions - since $\\sin(\\omega t) = \\text{Im}(e^{i\\omega t})$, we can write the time domain sinusoidal signals as follows:\n\n$$u(t) = U_0 \\; \\text{Im} \\left\\{ e^{i(\\omega t+ \\alpha)} \\right\\}$$\n$$y(t) = Y_0 \\; \\text{Im} \\left\\{ e^{i(\\omega t+ \\beta)} \\right\\}$$\n\nwhere:\n\n$$Y_0 = |G(i \\omega)| U_0 \\qquad \\qquad \\beta = \\measuredangle G(i \\omega) + \\alpha$$\n\nWe define the complex numbers $\\hat{u}$ and $\\hat{y}$ as follows^[Apologies to Skogestad and Postlethwaite, your notation sucks. I'm switching things out wherever I see fit.]\n\n$$\\hat{u}(\\omega) = U_0 e^{i \\alpha} \\qquad \\qquad \\hat{y}(\\omega) = Y_0 e^{i \\beta}$$\n\nso we can write the sinusoidal response as:\n\n$$ \\hat{y}(\\omega) e^{i\\omega t} = G(i\\omega) \\hat{u}(\\omega) e^{i\\omega t}$$\n\nor more succinctly:\n\n$$ \\hat{y}(\\omega) = G(i\\omega) \\hat{u}(\\omega) $$\n\nAdditionally, before we dive into the rest of the course, we should be able to sketch a Bode plot by hand. We have MATLAB/Python, but having the ability to sketch good straight-line approximations comes with the intuition of how placing additional zeros/poles affects the dynamic behavior of a system.\n\nPut briefly, the rules are as follows:\n\n- For magnitude plots, break down (subtract 20 dB/dec from the slope) at poles and break up (add 20 dB/dec to the slope) at zeroes.\n- For phase plots, phase -90$^\\circ$ at poles and phase +90$^\\circ$ at zeroes. (This rule is reversed of $\\text{Re}(z) > 0$).\n\nFor example, the transfer function\n\n$$G(s) = \\frac{30(s+1)}{(s+0.01)^2 (s+10)}$$\n\nhas one zero (at $s=-1$) and three poles (two at $s=-0.01$ and one at $s=-10$). First, we calculate the DC gain, or $G(0)$.\n\n$$G(0) = \\frac{30(0+1)}{(0+0.01)^2 (0+10)} = 30\\times 10^3$$\n\nSince $G(0) \\in \\mathbb{R}^+$, the initial phase is $0^\\circ$. Let's take a look at the actual Bode plot to see how we might approach this naturally:\n\n![](dem_bode.png){width=65% fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nThere's two poles at $s= -0.01 = 10^{-2}$, so the slope of the magnitude plot decreases by 40 dB/dec, and becomes -40 dB/dec (it breaks down twice), and the phase goes down to $-180^\\circ$.\n\nNext, there's a zero at $s = 1 = 10^0$, so the slope of the magnitude plot increases by 20 dB/dec, becoming -20 dB/dec (it breaks up once). The phase goes up to $-90^\\circ$.\n\nFinally, there's one more pole at $s = 10 = 10^1$, so the slope of the magnitude plot decreases by 20 dB/dec, becoming -40 dB/dec (it breaks down once). The phase once again goes down to $-180^\\circ$.\n\nArmed with just a Bode plot, we can make solid, educated guesses about the transfer function and infer things about stability.\n\n![](bd.png){width=65% fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nFinally, we take a peek at a one degree-of-freedom feedback control system, pictured above. The input to the controller $K$ is $r-y_m$, where $y_m = y+n$ is the measured output (used for negative feedback) and $n$ is measurement noise.\n\nSome quick block diagram algebra yields the following equation for the input to the plant:\n\n$$ u = K(r- y_m) = K (r - (y+n))$$\n\nOur goal with this controller is to tweak input $u$ such that the error $e = y-r$ remains small. \n\nThe plant model is written as:\n\n$$y = Gu + G_d \\, d = GK(r-(y+n)) + G_d \\, d$$\n\nWe continue chugging through algebra to isolate $y$:\n\n$$(I+GK) y = GKr + G_d \\, d - GKn$$\n$$y = (I+GK)^{-1} GKr + (I+GK)^{-1} G_d \\, d - (I+GK)^{-1} GKn$$\n\nWe define the following notation:\n\n- $L = GK$ is denoted the **loop transfer function**.\n- $S = (I+GK)^{-1} = (I+L)^{-1}$ is denoted the **sensitivity function**, the CLTF from the output disturbances to the outputs.\n- $T = (I+GK)^{-1} GK = (I+L)^{-1} L$ is denoted the **complementary sensitivity function**, the CLTF from the reference signals to the outputs.\n\nNotice that $S+T = I$.\n\nWe can now rewrite the closed-loop response as follows:\n\n$$y = Tr + S G_d \\, d - T n$$\n\nJust as a bonus, for SISO systems, the closed-loop transfer function (CLTF) rule for SISO systems with negative feedback can be summarized as follows:\n\n$$ \\text{CLTF} = \\frac{\\text{forward gain}}{1 + \\text{loop gain}} $$\n\nwhere \"forward gain\" represents the transfer function for the direct effect of the input on the output, and \"loop gain\" is the transfer function around the loop.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nA system is modeled by the transfer function $G(s)$ can also be represented using a state-space realization, as follows:\n\n$$ G(s) =  \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\begin{array}{c|c}\n  A & B \\\\\n  \\hline\n  C & D\n\\end{array}\n  \\end{bmatrix} \\qquad \\equiv \\qquad \\begin{eqnarray}\n  \\dot{x} &=& Ax + Bu \\\\\n  y &=& Cx + Du \\end{eqnarray}$$\n\nWe can take the Laplace transform of this representation to get the following formula:\n\n$$ G(s) = C(sI-A)^{-1} B + D $$\n\nWe say $G(s)$ is **strictly proper** if $G(i\\omega) \\to  0$ as $\\omega \\to \\infty$. $G(i\\omega)$ approaches 0 when the degree of the denominator is higher than that of the numerator.\n\nFor example, the transfer function\n\n$$G(s) = \\frac{1}{s+1}$$\n\nis strictly proper because:\n\n$$ \\deg (s+1) = 1 > \\deg (1) = 0$$\n\nLooking at the Bode plot of this transfer function shows that the magnitude continues to trend downwards towards $-\\infty$ dB, which is equal to 0 (by any reasonable metric).\n\n![](sp_bode.png){width=65% fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nWe say $G(s)$ is **semiproper/biproper** if the degree of the denominator is equal to that of the numerator, and $G(s)$ is **proper** if it is strictly proper or semiproper.
